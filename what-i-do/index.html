<h4>Commercial work</h4>
<p>
  I am a freelance web developer and consultant with over 10 years of experience.
  I build web applications mainly using
  <a title="Ruby on Rails" href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Through consultations with my clients I help them define their requirements
  and execute it from start to finish. If required I can also help assemble and
  lead a team of web professionals.
</p>
<p>
  For more information (about my availability, rates, estimates, etc.) or if
  you&#8217;d like to hire me you can

<h4>Blogs</h4>
<p>
  At the moment I maintain an
  <a title="Icebergist web development blog" href="http://icebergist.com">Icebergist</a>
  blog (a.k.a. <a title="Icebergist blog" href="http://icebergist.com">Orange Iceberg blog</a>)
  in which I write about both technical and business stuff I deal with daily.
  From Ruby on Rails programming to time organizing, everything that&#8217;s
  important in my daily work.
</p>
<p>
  Since I started

<p>
  I also have a small tumble log called &#8220;
  <a title="Tumblelog by Slobodan Kovacevic" href="http://tumblelog.slobodankovacevic.com/">
    this should be interesting
  </a>
  &#8221; where I post small bits of information which I find useful or interesting.

  If you are really into tracking me, you should check my
  <a title="Slobodan Kovacevic's Twitter feed" href="http://twitter.com/thebasti">Twitter feed</a>
  where I ramble daily (unless I am to lazy or too busy to do so).

<h4>Open Coffee Club Novi Sad</h4>
<p>
  In 2007 I started organizing a local
  <a title="Open Coffee Club Novi Sad" href="http://www.opencoffeenovisad.org/">Open Coffee Club</a>
  in Novi Sad. Open Coffee Club meetings are informal gatherings for web
  professionals where we can exchange opinions and talk about latest tech stuff.
</p>

<h4>Open Source</h4>
<p>
  So far my involvement with Open Source was limited to submitting bug reports
  and adding some translations (for example for Rails Localization plugin
  L10n-simplified). But I am working on changing that, so watch this space.
