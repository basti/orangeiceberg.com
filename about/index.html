<p>
  Orange Iceberg web development is a sole proprietorship of Slobodan Kovačević.
  Which is just a fancy way of saying that I do freelance work under the name of
  Orange Iceberg.
  <a title="Hire me" href="/contact">Want to hire me?</a>
</p>

<h4>Who am I?</h4>
<p>
  My name is Slobodan Kovačević. I have been a professional web developer for
  past decade, more precisely since 1998. Computers have been my love since I
  was a little kid and I have been messing with them way before I started using
  them professionally.
</p>
<p>
  I have been freelancing from 1998 until September 2001 when I co-founded Array
  Studio, a small web development company which at one point had grew up to 6
  developers/designers. Over period of 7 years I worked as CEO and lead
  developer in Array Studio.
</p>
<p>
  In June 2008 I sold my share of Array Studio and went back to freelancing
  through Orange Iceberg.

<h4>Why the name Orange Iceberg?</h4>
<p>
  An iceberg is sometimes over 90% underwater and only tip is visible. Well,
  most web applications (and software in general) are like that too &#8211;
  there&#8217;s a pretty user interface that makes about 10% of a web app, and
  then 90% of the programming work is under the covers.
</p>
<p>
  I make web apps and web apps are like icebergs in some sense, so it just made
  sense.
</p>
<p>
  And why Orange&#8230; Well, why not?

<h4>What do I do?</h4>
<p>
  Last year or two I have been focusing on creating web apps using Ruby on Rails,
  but before that I have mainly used PHP for web development. Actually,
  there&#8217;s a
