      <h4>More About Orange Iceberg.</h4>
      <p>
        Orange Iceberg is a small web development consultancy focused on transforming
        <a href="#cwrap" title="Clients we worked with and built great Ruby on Rails web applications">our client's</a>
        ideas to functional web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        We specialize in building web applications using Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
        However depending on a project we often assemble and lead a team of various web professionals,
        with help from our
        <a href="#awrap" title="People who help us build Ruby on Rails web applications">associates</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Why the name Orange Iceberg?</h4>
      <p>
        An iceberg is often over 90% underwater with only tip being visible.
        Most web applications (and software in general) are like that too.
        There's a pretty interface that makes about 10% of a web app, but
        underneath it there's still 90% of the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        We make web applications. They are like icebergs in some sense.
        It just made sense.
      </p>

      <h4>Who am I?</h4>
      <p>
        My name is Slobodan Kovačević. I have been a professional web developer for
        past decade, more precisely since 1998. Computers have been my love since I
        was a little kid and I have been messing with them way before I started using
        them professionally.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been freelancing from 1998 until September 2001 when I co-founded Array
        Studio, a small web development company which at one point had grew up to 6
        developers/designers. Over period of 7 years I worked as CEO and lead
        developer in Array Studio.
      </p>
      <p>
        In June 2008 I sold my share of Array Studio and went back to freelancing
        through Orange Iceberg.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>

      <h4>What do I do?</h4>
      <p>
        Last year or two I have been focusing on creating web apps using Ruby on Rails,
        but before that I have mainly used PHP for web development. Actually,
        there&#8217;s a
        <a title="Services provided by Orange Iceberg" href="/what-i-do">What do I do page</a>
        &#8211; so read it for more details.
